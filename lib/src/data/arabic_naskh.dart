const arabicNaskhPatternText = r'''# Classical Arabic Naskh kashida pattern set, based largely on Benatia’s matrix:
# [B06] Benatia, Elyaakoubi & Lazrek (2006), TUGboat 27(2):137–146, figure 25
# and its legend in §3.4.
# with overriding rules from:
# [Afifi] Fawzi Salim Afifi, “Learning Arabic Calligraphy”, part 3.
#
# The matrix scores each (stretched letter, following letter) pair, encoded
# as a priority that drops with run length:
#   9\6  recommended  (Benatia "+")
#   6\3  neutral      (an unsigned number)
#   3\0  discouraged  (Benatia "−")
# and an empty cell compiles to no rule at all.
#
# The `[:4:]` guard means the priority is highest in a 4-letter run and drops
# by 1 for every letter away from that, either way. This is how we handle the
# [B06] §3.2 word-length rules: 4-letter words stretch best, 5 is disputed,
# and longer ones defer to the matrix. [B06] applies the matrix to runs of 4
# or more only. We apply it to runs of 2 and 3 as well, where the guard gives
# them a lower priority.


# [B06] §3.2: no kashida before a final yeh (handled by the Afifi rules at
# the end)

# [B06] §3.4 figure 25, the matrix itself: within each
# block followers are grouped by priority (not the paper's column order).

# p. 5: no elongation occurs before the letters sad, ain, waw, heh, or a final feh.
# p. 10: no space may be stretched before a sad.
# p. 12: do not stretch a space before the letters feh, qaf, or waw.
# Hah below is my own, no source explicitly mentions it, but hah connects from top
# so can’t have a kashida.

# p. 14: no elongation may be made after lam.
# Muhammad Mu’nis in his al-Mizan al-ma’luf explicitly says lam is treated
# exactly like beh and gives examples of stretching initial and medial lam.
